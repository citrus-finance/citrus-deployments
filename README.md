# Citrus deployments

This repository contains everything that is needed to deploy the Citrus ecosystem.

## Usage

First make sure, your `.env` is setup. If you only deploying contracts, you only needs env vars in the Apply section.

One you have your `.env` ready, you now run `yarn hardhat apply`. This will deploy all required contracts.
